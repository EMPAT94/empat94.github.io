  <h2>Chapter 42 - A Proper Mage</h2>
<p>&quot;PETRIFICUS_TOTALUS!&quot; I shouted, and flash-froze a labrador-sized lizard with shark-like teeth. The last of its group that had swarmed me. Of course, I was already aware of them due to my new radar powers and had taken down two before they even realized they were under attack.</p>
<p>The sun was high up in the sky, straight above my head. This was the second group of monsters that I had engaged with since I left the camp in the morning, all on my lonesome. I encountered a lot many of them, but mostly I just hid or detoured.</p>
<p>I took shelter in a nearby tree shade, after making sure no monsters lurked nearby. The trees had grown more numerous and green as I traveled. Pulling the waterskin out, I drank the last of its content. Half the water had been wasted on cleaning some of the grime I accrued from the earlier encounter. Not having Tyee to distract the monsters was leaving me fighting them off in closer range than I would like.</p>
<p>Despite the circumstances, I felt I was making good progress. I did not put my &quot;full-force&quot; behind each attack, starting from attacks with twice their normal mana, then moving up from there as necessary. And I never faced any monster without preparing a set of &quot;Rune Traps&quot; first. I had not revealed this trick in front of Tyee for fear of reprisal. Stupefy was my new favorite trap and also an emergency fall-back Spell if any unlucky monster got close enough. My eyes glanced over the charred remains of the scaly creature that had stepped into my Circle of Stupefy.</p>
<p>The mountains seemed to loom ahead on the horizon as always, giving me little sense of how close I was. GPS and Map would've been very helpful. Hell, even some landmarks and a compass would've been appreciated. I closed my eyes and relaxed, unintentionally letting the waterskin fall from my grasp down into the dirt. 'Right. Water.'</p>
<p>I was not technically tired, simply wanting to get away from the sun. And with nothing to distract me, this seemed like a good opportunity to explore my new abilities in depth. And I would inevitably need more water.</p>
<p>'So... a water spell.'</p>
<p>I pulled up my repository and started with a test function like usual:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">create_water_test =
</code></pre>
<p>'Alright, I remember watching some documentary about the desert. They were taking water right out of the air when it condensed.'</p>
<p>I already had a spell to lower the temperature, and now I could select any random volume in space. That seemed to fit the bill perfectly for the job.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">create_water_test v = petrificus_slowly v
</code></pre>
<p>I selected a small golf-ball-sized sphere over my palm and muttered &quot;create_water_test&quot;.</p>
<p>Less than a minute later I could feel the cold air grazing my palm. While there was no magical droplet of water in the sphere, it did start condensing on my skin.</p>
<p>I smiled, a step in the right direction. But that was the easy part.</p>
<p>I needed water to drink, and clean myself if I had some leftover. Having a couple of droplets was a start but I needed enough to fill the waterskin at least. And fast. It was unwise to linger in one place for long.</p>
<p>I figured the simplest way to condense more water was to occupy a bigger volume. I had a rough sense of how big a volume I could target - closer to a 10 by 10-meter cube. That restriction would hopefully not be an issue.</p>
<p>'Now, how to pull all the condensed water vapor into the waterskin?'</p>
<p>I thought back to Betty's spell, where she utilized gravity to elevate herself. I figured I'd give it a try.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">pull_down x = while true; do x.gravity--; done;
</code></pre>
<p>I selected a loose leaf from an overhanging branch. &quot;pull_down&quot; I whispered. The leaf stubbornly stood unmoving. I also verified my mana points, they were regenerating quite well without any noticeable dip.</p>
<p>'That's a bust then. What next? What other environment variables should I try? Elevation worked last time, maybe brute-force it? It might work on a leaf, but I doubt it will work to pull a large volume of gas into the waterskin. Maybe I could move the waterbag through the condensed air instead?'</p>
<p>I briefly considered the documentary again. They had a large plastic sheet that had a stone or some weight in the center to guide the droplets into a mug they placed below it. I was trying to do something similar, but also not. My water vapor would be cold and ready to shift phase, but there wasn't a plastic sheet handy for that to happen. I needed to pull all the air into and through the waterskin, where it would fill up.</p>
<p>'Alright, forget environment variables. What else?'</p>
<p>I was in a simulation. A virtual reality. I remembered some tinkering I had done with a 3d game engine years ago. And the more recent work on browser canvas APIs.</p>
<p>'All objects occupy some space on a co-ordinate system.'</p>
<p>A flood of new ideas was let loose, I let my mind grasp those concepts and apply them in this context.</p>
<p>'Alright, on the canvas at least I knew the absolute coordinates of each entity. Here, I have no clue. Hmm... so relative it is!'</p>
<p>I selected the same leaf again, now swaying in the slight breeze but still clinging on.</p>
<p>'So, if I want to pull it into my hand, I'll set my palm as the origin. x, y, and z coordinate set to zero.'</p>
<p>Starting from my palm up towards the tree, I selected a cone-like volume with the leaf just inside the flat base.</p>
<p>'Oh right, need to update the function!'</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">pull_down o = while true; do o.x--; o.y--; o.z--; done;
</code></pre>
<p>I did not know the esoteric mathematical equations needed to pinpoint the position of the leaf inside the volume, but I did not need them. Since I was reducing its coordinates to zero, it would move to my hand no matter where it was.</p>
<p>I had a pretty good feeling about this one. The system seemed to consider &quot;intent&quot; when parsing functions, and since my functional logic was flawless, I did not expect to fail.</p>
<p>&quot;pull_down,&quot; I spoke up, keeping my palm as steady as possible.</p>
<p>The leaf stopped swaying. I noticed my mana regeneration slow down but overall mana kept increasing. The spell didn't seem so mana hungry but was taking far too long to produce any effect. So I forced it along by adding 100 mana to the process.</p>
<p>The leaf immediately tugged free of the branch and slapped down into the ground beside me instead of my hand. So much for &quot;flawless&quot; logic. But it didn't diminish the joy in my heart. The system may have kept the abstraction of environment variables hidden from me, but I was not above getting my hands dirty with some low-level hacking. &quot;Heh, take that!&quot; I kicked the leaf at the imaginary creators. It merely tumbled away, free of my magic.</p>
<p>&quot;Right, back to the main task! Need to account for negative co-ordinates.&quot;</p>
<p>I modified the water function to pull condensed vapors in at the point.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">
pull_down o = while true; do
  if [[ o.x &gt; 0 ]]; then o.x--; fi;
  if [[ o.y &gt; 0 ]]; then o.y--; fi;
  if [[ o.z &gt; 0 ]]; then o.z--; fi;
done;

create_water_test v = petrificus_slowly v | pull_down

</code></pre>
<p>My mana was above 3000 now, I decided to go all out. Picking up the waterskin from the ground, I stood up and held it in my hand, then selected a conical area again, but now as big as I possibly could.</p>
<p>&quot;create_water_test,&quot; I almost shouted, and poured a thousand mana into the spell. It was perhaps a tad bit too much, as immediately, super-cooled air squeezed into the waterskin and threatened to blow it away like an errant balloon. I used my other hand to support it from below, and it stood safe despite making a whining noise from all the air whooshing in.</p>
<p>It went on for several seconds, and I noticed my hands numb from the cold. So numb that I had missed the glistening drops of water falling from them, forming a damp circle in the dirt below. It slowed down after a while, and I activated my Circle of Protection as well. 'Next time, I should activate it <em>before</em> starting the experiment like a sane person.'</p>
<p>My hands warmed down pretty fast after that. And I noticed a heft to the waterskin I was holding. It was perhaps quarter filled. I took a cold sip. I wasn't thirsty but boy that felt good! Sweet rewards of hard work.</p>
<p>Of course, the next step was to change the names of the functions, something I dreaded and loved in equal measure. It was easier this time, as I actually remembered something related.</p>
<p>First, I renamed my &quot;pull_down&quot; function, then used it with the Latin word for water to make a cool sounding spell:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">
accio o = while true; do o.x--; o.y--; o.z--; done;

accio_aqua v = petrificus_slowly v | accio

</code></pre>
<p>I could already imagine the scary reusable utility of accio. There was already a half-formed idea of using it to hurl huge molten boulders at monsters. 'Perhaps something to &quot;push&quot; as well?' Instead of reducing coordinates to zero, I would simply increase them, moving all objects in a volume away from whatever I designate as the origin. Not unlike a &quot;Universal Push&quot;. I snickered. 'Perhaps stick to a single naming theme?' A thought for the future anyway.</p>
<p>I tied the waterskin to a rope that I had fastened around my waist, as a belt of sorts. The sun had slid slightly ahead and to the right. Still unceasingly hot and right in front of my eyes. I deactivated the Circle of Protection, my mana stooping below 1000. But without any active spell, I watched it climb back up in great strides. I pulled the hood over my eyes and settled in the now lengthy shadow of the tree.</p>
<p>Alone. Truly alone for the first time. I wasn't <em>scared</em> per se. But I was loath to take even a light nap. Having people around did wonders for anxiety. Not that I was anxious yet. But I knew time was not on my side. Sure, the water situation was resolved, but food was still an issue. I had enough rations to last me a couple of days, four if I stretched. Hunger would hold me then. 'If only there was a way to magic food!'</p>
<p>I couldn't rest as I had hoped. I kept scanning the landscape actively every few seconds for magical movement, fearing I might miss it if I wasn't paying attention. All a monster had to do was get in range to bite me. And not all monsters need a bite to be lethal. Even with all the power I had, the situation was quite ridiculous. 'I need a shield spell or something.' For now, I did plan to have the place wherever I camped absolutely packed with Circles from all sides, but that didn't seem like a sustainable strategy. 'Maybe something that could create a dome of protection or a barrier? Perhaps an instant escape route as well, like teleport or something?'</p>
<p>The new ability was letting my inner nerd out. I already knew teleport was possible, having done it once. But it likely messed with numerous environment variables and required privileges not accessible to me. I touched briefly on the other tele-like spells. Telepathy I discarded, for now, something like the message crystals would be useful instead. Another thought occurred. 'Holy... am I capable of telekinesis now?' Technically, I could only pull and push stuff. But since I could specify in which direction that would happen, that might as well be the real deal. The smile on my face returned. I was resembling a proper mage now. I decided to abandon the idea of resting and got up, continuing my solo travel. Hopefully heading in the right direction.</p>
