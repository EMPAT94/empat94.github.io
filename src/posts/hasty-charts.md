title: Hasty Charts
---

I recently got to work on an email campaign where I had to send emails to our users with their monthly usage statistics.

I wanted to show the stats in a pleasing visual format instead of dull numbers. So I turned to charts!

After lots of twists and turns, I ended up creating my own function to render charts.

This is how the chart looks with sample data:

Check out the code [Gist Link](https://gist.github.com/p-tupe/818b0b5e41e4c37b30d3407d6247ca52):

<div style="max-width:85vw;">
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/p-tupe/818b0b5e41e4c37b30d3407d6247ca52.js"></script>
</div>
